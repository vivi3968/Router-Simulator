# Router-Simulator

This project imitates a simple network of routers by writing a simulator and is a simple representation of the actual network that is implemented today. Information is packed into a single entity called a packet, which contains the sender's information, and also extra overhead bits that describes certain properties of the packet. Some of these bits are used to determine the path it takes to maneuver through the network. Packets travel through routers across the network, until they have arrived to their specified destination.
